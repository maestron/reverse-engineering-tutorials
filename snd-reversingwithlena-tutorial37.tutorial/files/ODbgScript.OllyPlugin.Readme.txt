1. About ODbgScript
-------------------
ODbgScript is a plugin for OllyDbg, which is, in our opinion, 
the best application-mode debugger out there. One of the best 
features of this debugger is the plugin architecture which allows 
users to extend its functionality. ODbgScript is a plugin 
meant to let you automate OllyDbg by writing scripts in an 
assembly-like language. Many tasks involve a lot of repetitive 
work just to get to some point in the debugged application. By 
using my plugin you can write a script once and for all. 

------------------------------

2. Status
----------------------------

v1.0
OllyScript becomes ODbgScript with the new GUI Window

v0.9
OllyScript has now been downloaded more then 10000 times! That means more then 2Gb of raw
scripting power flowing down the optic cable veins of the Internet. Not bad if you ask me!
The development of the plugin has been a bit slow, I've got a job programming xray systems
which has taken a lot of time. Sorry about that.

2.1 What's new?

3. Documentation
----------------
Example script (sample.osc) is available with this release. 
The script will break on LoadLibray call to debug a SHELL32.DLL function. 
Try it on mspaint.exe

3.1 Language
------------
The scripting language of OllyScript is an assembly-like language.

In the document below, src and dest can be (unless stated otherwise):
 - Constant in the form of a hex number withot prefixes and suffixes (i.e. 00FF, not 0x00FF or 00FFh)
   For decimal values, use the point (i.e. 100. 128.)
 - Variable previously declared by VAR, or are declared with MOV
 - A 32-bit register (one of EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP, EIP).
   A 16-bit register (one of AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, SP)
   A 8-bit register (one of AL, AH, ... DL, DH)
 - A memory reference in square brackets (i.e. [401000] points to the memory at address 401000, 
	[ecx] points to the memory at address ecx).
 - A flag with an exclamation mark in front (one of !CF, !PF, !AF, !ZF, !SF, !DF, !OF)
 - Sometimes byte strings are required. those are scripted as #6A0000# (values between two #) and 
	must have an even number of characters.
   Some byte strings can contain the wildcard '?', for exampla #6A??00# or #6?0000#
 - A combinaison of this values with operators :

You can use operators in your scripts, +-*/&|^>< for dword and + to concatenate strings.
 - Operators > and < are shr and shl (>> and << in C/C++)
 - Operator ^ is XOR 
 - Operator & is AND
 - Operator | is OR

Logs src to OllyDbg log window.
If src is a constant string the string is logged as it is.
If src is a variable or register its logged with its name.
You can replace default prefix with the optional second parameter.
Example:
	log "Hello world" // The string "Hello world" is logged
	var x
	mov x, 10
	log x // The string "x: 00000010" is logged.
	log x, "" // The string "00000010" is logged.

MOV dest, src [,maxsize]
-------------
Move src to dest.
Src can be a long hex string in the format #<some hex numbers>#, for example #1234#.
Remember that the number of digits in the hex string must be even, i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8 etc.
Example: 
	mov x, 0F
	mov y, "Hello world"
	mov eax, ecx
	mov [ecx], #00DEAD00BEEF00#

MSGYN message
-----------
Display a message box with specified message and YES and NO buttons.
Sets the reserved $RESULT variable to 1 if YES is selected and 0 otherwise.
Example:
	MSGYN "Continue?"

OR dest, src
-------------
ORs src and dest and stores result in dest
Example: 
	or x, 0F
	or eax, x
	or [401000], 5

OPCODE addr
-----------
OPCODE sets the $RESULT variable to the opcode bytes, $RESULT_1 variable to mnemonic opcode (i.e. "MOV ECX,EAX") 
and $RESULT_2 to the length of the opcode. 
If an invalid opcode appears, $RESULT_2 should be 0. 
addr is increased by the length of the opcode (disassemble command). 
With this function you can step forward through code. 
Example: 
	opcode 00401000

PAUSE
-----
Pauses script execution. Script can be resumed from plugin menu.
Example:
	pause

PREOP addr
----------
Get asm command line address just before specified address.
Attention: Will not give real executed command eip before the jump.
Example:
	preop eip

REF addr
--------
REF addr works as "Find references to .. Selected command" and "Find references", Ctrl R, in OllyDbg.
$RESULT variable is set to the first reference addr 
$RESULT_1 to the opcode (text asm command) 
$RESULT_2 to the comment (like reference window). 
Repeat "REF addr" until $RESULT=0 to get next refs
Example:
	continue:
		REF eip
		log $RESULT
		log $RESULT_1
		log $RESULT_2
	cmp $RESULT,0
	jne continue

REPL addr, find, repl, len
--------------------------
Replace find with repl starting att addr for len bytes.
Wildcards are allowed
Example:
	repl eip, #6a00#, #6b00#, 10
	repl eip, #??00#, #??01#, 10
	repl 401000, #41#, #90#, 1F

RET
---
Exits script.
Example:
	ret

REV
---
Reverse dword bytes.
Example:
	rev 01020304
	//$RESULT = 04030201

RTR
---
Executes "Run to return" in OllyDbg
Example:
	rtr

RTU
---
Executes "Run to user code" in OllyDbg
Example:
	rtu

RUN
---
Executes F9 in OllyDbg
Example:
	run

SCMP dest, src
-------------
Compares strings dest to src. Works like it's ASM counterpart.
Example: 
	cmp x, "KERNEL32.DLL"
	cmp [eax], "Hello World"

SCMPI dest, src
-------------
Compares strings dest to src (case insentitive). Works like it's ASM counterpart.
Example: 
	cmp sVar, "KERNEL32.DLL"
	cmp [eax], "Hello World"

SHL dest, src
-------------
Shifts dest to the left src times and stores the result in dest.
Example:
	mov x, 00000010
	shl x, 8 // x is now 00001000

SHR dest, src
-------------
Shifts dest to the right src times and stores the result in dest.
Example:
	mov x, 00001000
	shr x, 8 // x is now 00000010

STI
---
Execute F7 in OllyDbg.
Example:
	sti

STO
---
Execute F8 in OllyDbg.
Example:
	sto

SUB dest, src
-------------
Substracts src from dest and stores result in dest
Example: 
	sub x, 0F
	sub eax, x
	sub [401000], 5

TC
--
Executes "Close (and delete) Run Trace" in OllyDbg
Example:
	tc

TI
--
Executes "Trace into" in OllyDbg
Example:
	ti

TICND cond
----------
Traces into calls until cond is true
Example:
	ticnd "eip > 40100A" // will stop when eip > 40100A

TO
--
Executes "Trace over" in OllyDbg
Example:
	to

TOCND cond
----------
Traces over calls until cond is true
Example:
	tocnd "eip > 40100A" // will stop when eip > 40100A

VAR
---
Declare a variable to be used in the script. 
Must be done before the variable is used.
Example: 
	var x

XOR dest, src
-------------
XORs src and dest and stores result in dest
Example: 
	xor x, 0F
	xor eax, x
	xor [401000], 5

WRT file, data
-------------
Write to file (replace existing one) the only accepted symbol is "\r\n"
Numbers are wrote as strings... for the moment
Example: 
	wrt "out.txt", "Data:\r\nOk\r\n"
	wrt sFile, ebx

WRTA file, data
-------------
Append to file
Example: 
	wrta sFile, "hello world\r\n"


3.2 Labels
----------
Labels are defined bu using the label name followed by a colon.
Example:
	SOME_LABEL:

3.3 Comments
------------
Comments can be put anywhere and have to start with "//". 
Block comments between "/*" and "*/"

3.4 Menus
---------
The main OllyScript menu consists of the following items:
- Run script...: lets the user select a script file and starts it
- Abort: aborts a running script
- Pause: pauses a running script
- Resume: resumes a paused script
- About: shows information about this plugin

3.5 Script Window
-----------------
The Script Window was introduced with ODbgScript, it enables you to debug
and see progression of your script.
You can set script breakpoints, debug the script, edit variables and also 
execute commands manually.

------------------------------

4. Integration with other plugins
---------------------------------
You can call OllyScript from your plugin and make it execute a script.
Use something like the source code below:

HMODULE hMod = GetModuleHandle("ODbgScript.dll");
if(hMod) // Check that the other plugin is present and loaded
{
	// Get address of exported function
	int (*pFunc)(char*) = (int (*)(char*)) GetProcAddress(hMod, "ExecuteScript");
	if(pFunc) // Check that the other plugin exports the correct function
		pFunc("myscript.txt"); // Execute exported function
}

------------------------------
